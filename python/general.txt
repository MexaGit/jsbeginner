# use to add a comment of one line

If you add \ in final line of the command you tell that the statement is not over .eg:
2.0 + 5 * \
4

def = define function  

procedence: not-and-or this mean that NOT it evaluated firs then AND and finally OR
and not == != means that not is checkin before or first than AND 'or' OR so NOT means the opossite of TRUE or FALSE depending of the case

5 is 8 is equal to 5 === 8 is False 
5 is not 8 is equal 5 != 8 is True

They computer reads read commands from the TOP to Bottom!

def plus(parameter):
plus(arguments)

return can be used only once in a function!

list_string = ['Edd', 'Ed', 'Eddy'] 
you can access the list by indexing the value [0, 1, 2] = to the elements in the list ['Edd', 'Ed', 'Eddy']

Tuples are a atype or data sequences
Tuples they are inmutable: you can delete or add elements, use () not []
The values a packed on Tuples

Dictionaries represent another way of storing data = {}

Iteration (lopps) is the ability to execute a certain code repeatedly

OOP has class (bike) and the class as atributes as: color, zise, type; and methods such: turn_left, turn_right, slow_down, etc. 
List (Class)
Object(Instance) = ['Edd', 'Ed', 'Eddy']
Atributes(Properties) = type of data: floats

Search. List.extends()

BigO = Is a measure of how a particular algorithm scales when you through more data at it, how much time take to do something, how much time or space it takes a computer with a particular algorithm.

O(n) = for loop it executed only on time, linear time 
O(n*2) = for loop that have another for loop nested, so the time that takes to process grow up rapidly
O(n!) = n factorial, this is the worst scenario, loop of loops

Tip to code: first write your code solution ideas, last step write the code solution
