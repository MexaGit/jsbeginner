Every Kafka broker is also called a "bootstrap server"

Producers can choose to receive acknowledgment of data writes:
acks=all : Leader + replicas acknowledgment(no data loss)

If you use Brokers, you need to use Zookeeper:
Zookeeper manages brokers (keep a list of them), send notifications of changes, etc.

But never ever use Zookeeper as a configuration in your Kafka Clients 
if you usea program and you are going to connect don't use Zookeper, only connect to Kafka

Kafka now implementents the Raft protocol (XRaft) in order to replace Zookeeper
