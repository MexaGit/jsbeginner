What is a web service?
Web = Internet 
Service = API
Web service = API that uses the internet
So, all web services is an API but not all APIs are web service. Not all APIs use the internet.

Web Services use:
    * XML or JSON to format data over the internet
    * REST, SOAP, or XML/RPC to transfer that data

Stateless
State = Current situation (in context)
State HTTP = Web Request and Response
Less = Without
HTTP Stateless: Request unknown
HTTP methods: REST and SOAP
REST: Representational State Transfer
SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
Stateful: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
WSDL: Web Service Description Language

REST: Representational State Transfer
Methods: Get, Post, Put, Delete
No rules (unlike SOAP)

SAML is basically a session cookie in your browser that gives you access to webapps
OAuth is a delegated authorization framework for REST/APIs. Allows a third party access. Limit access

Authentication = proving your indentity
Authorization = limited access

Type of Apps: Native, Web and Hybrid

Postman
Basic Authentication: Access an API using username and password - not very secure
Digest Authentication: A way of proving your in by using a digest - use HTTP - not used very often
Bearer Token: holder can use to get access to an API
OAuth API: delegated limited authorization to an application (app) - App uses access token

Microservices: APIs - multi
